# Real-World Event Sourcing

Personal notes and code exercises from [Real-World Event Sourcing](https://pragprog.com/titles/khpes/real-world-event-sourcing/).  

As a seasoned CQRS/ES developer, I don't expect to learn so much about the pattern by itself, I'm more focus here on:  

- how the author introduces and teaches the concepts
- how CQRS/ES fits the Elixir's built-in actor model
